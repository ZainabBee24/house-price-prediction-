# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Supervised Learning

This project demonstrates a supervised learning regression model developed to predict house prices based on key features like area, number of rooms, and available amenities. Using a cleaned dataset, a Linear Regression model was trained and evaluated, achieving an R² score of 64.9%. The model's performance indicates a moderate level of accuracy, with an average prediction error of approximately ₦980K. Further improvements can be explored using advanced algorithms and feature engineering. The project was built using Python and Scikit-learn, and visualized through Matplotlib and Seaborn.
